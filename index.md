##Hello welcome!

##Desktop Goose
By samperson
HONK HONK, HEAR YE. I have created a goose for your desktop.
He'll nab your mouse, track mud on your screen... leave you a message, deliver you memes?
Play video games with a desktop buddy who will attack you if you poke him.
Fill out spreadsheets while your screen fills up with instances of Goose Notepad.

##I am not the owner but i have the file!
